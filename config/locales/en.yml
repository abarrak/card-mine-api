    about: >
      Card Mine works as a card factory engine that helps you generate different kinds of cards along 
      with stamps of formatted text, then persist them in the cloud.
      
      With Car Mine, you can make and share cards with your friends, family, and loved ones.
                  
      It's essentially implemented to be the back-end to my capstone project for Udacity iOS nanodegree.
      
      Happy Journey! :)
